# Learning-SageMath
A repository of my SageMath notebooks. I mostly use these to keep track of my progress, and keep a record of the things I've learned.

I am reading *Mathematical Computation with SageMath* [https://members.loria.fr/PZimmermann/sagebook/english.html]

##Update:
I am putting this on pause at the moment. Need to resume from Section 2.4 of the book.

I did however finish Chapter 3.
